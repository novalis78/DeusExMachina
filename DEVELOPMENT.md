# Deus Ex Machina: Development Plan

This document outlines the development roadmap for Deus Ex Machina, organizing future enhancements while maintaining the project's core philosophy of minimalism, modularity, and self-sufficiency.

## Development Principles

1. **Minimal External Dependencies** - Use native Linux tools and standard libraries whenever possible
2. **Unix Philosophy** - Simple components that do one thing well and work together
3. **Kernel-Style Approach** - Tight, efficient code with low resource footprint
4. **Modularity** - Components that can function independently or as part of the whole
5. **Progressive Autonomy** - Carefully expand decision-making capabilities with appropriate safeguards

## Phase 1: Memory System (2-3 weeks)

**Goal:** Add persistent memory to enable learning and trend analysis.

### Tasks:

1. **Create SQLite database foundation**
   - Design schema for metrics, events, and state history
   - Implement automatic rotation and cleanup of old data
   - Add transaction logging for system actions

2. **Implement metric collectors**
   - Enhance heartbeat to store metrics in SQLite
   - Add simple trend calculation (7-day and 30-day averages)
   - Create baseline deviation detection

3. **Add memory module**
   - Create `memory.py` for querying historical data
   - Implement event correlation matching
   - Add statistical anomaly detection for metrics

**Deliverables:**
- SQLite database schema
- Enhanced heartbeat module with storage capabilities
- `memory.py` for historical data analysis
- Basic statistical analysis functions

## Phase 2: Self-Healing (2-3 weeks)

**Goal:** Enable automated remediation of common issues.

### Tasks:

1. **Create action engine**
   - Design secure command execution framework
   - Implement permission levels for different actions
   - Add rollback capabilities for critical changes

2. **Build response library**
   - Create scripts for common recoveries (service restart, disk cleanup)
   - Implement diagnostic routines for deeper analysis
   - Add templated responses with safety constraints

3. **Add decision module**
   - Create rules engine for mapping conditions to actions
   - Implement audit logging for all automatic actions
   - Add confirmation protocol for high-risk operations

**Deliverables:**
- `action_engine.py` for secure command execution
- Library of recovery scripts and diagnostics
- `decision.py` for rules-based response selection
- Comprehensive audit logging system

## Phase 3: Proactive Intelligence (3-4 weeks)

**Goal:** Shift from reactive to anticipatory management.

### Tasks:

1. **Create prediction engine**
   - Implement time-series forecasting for resource usage
   - Add pattern matching for recurring issues
   - Create schedule optimization for maintenance tasks

2. **Build threat modeling**
   - Add fingerprinting for suspicious activity patterns
   - Implement behavioral baselining for users and services
   - Create preemptive hardening recommendations

3. **Enhance AI integration**
   - Extend Gemini prompts to include historical context
   - Implement feedback loop between actions and outcomes
   - Add "reasoning" module for explaining decisions

**Deliverables:**
- `prediction.py` for time-series analysis and forecasting
- Threat modeling and fingerprinting system
- Enhanced AI prompt templates with historical context
- `reasoning.py` for decision explanation

## Phase 4: Modular Expansion (2-3 weeks)

**Goal:** Create plugin architecture for specialized capabilities.

### Tasks:

1. **Design plugin system**
   - Create standardized interface for module registration
   - Implement secure sandboxing for third-party modules
   - Add configuration system for module management

2. **Build core plugins**
   - Create backup/restore module
   - Implement network monitoring extension
   - Add software update management

3. **Document extension API**
   - Create developer documentation for module creation
   - Implement example plugins
   - Add testing framework for plugin validation

**Deliverables:**
- Plugin architecture and module interface
- Core plugin implementations for critical functionality
- Developer documentation for the extension API
- Testing framework for plugin validation

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with the memory system** as it's the foundation for everything else
2. **Use feature toggles** to gradually enable new capabilities
3. **Implement comprehensive logging** for all new features
4. **Create unit and integration tests** before adding functionality
5. **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing modules

This approach allows incremental improvement while maintaining a stable core system, with each phase building logically on the previous one.

## Roadmap Beyond Phase 4

Future development directions could include:

1. **Advanced Learning Capabilities**
   - Simple machine learning for pattern recognition
   - Reinforcement learning for action optimization
   - Anomaly detection using clustering algorithms

2. **Inter-System Communication**
   - Secure communication between multiple instances
   - Collective intelligence across system clusters
   - Federated learning for improved threat detection

3. **Enhanced Autonomy**
   - Progressive trust building through successful actions
   - Simulation-based testing of remediation strategies
   - Human-guided learning for complex scenarios

4. **Specialized Plugins**
   - Domain-specific modules for different environments
   - Application-aware modules for specific workloads
   - Hardware-specific optimizations and monitoring
