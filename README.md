# Deus Ex Machina

> A self-aware, token-efficient AI agent designed to maintain, monitor, and protect a Linux server through intelligent observation cycles: heartbeat, breath, and vigilance.

## Vision

**Deus Ex Machina** is a lightweight, modular, and optionally AI-augmented system that brings mindfulness to machine maintenance. Inspired by the biological rhythms of life and consciousness, this system ensures the continuous well-being of a Linux server without excessive resource use. It makes decisions based on priority, context, and a limited budget (token or compute/time-based).

## Core Principles

- **Minimal Impact**: Every operation should justify its resource cost.
- **Situational Awareness**: The agent should always know the current system state with high confidence.
- **Event Responsiveness**: Escalate awareness depth only when conditions change.
- **Modularity**: Each module can run independently or cooperatively.
- **Auditability**: Every decision and state transition is logged and explainable.

---

## Monitoring the System

The enhanced Deus Ex Machina system can be easily monitored through its comprehensive logging. For a complete guide on monitoring, understanding the system's behavior, and troubleshooting, please refer to our [Monitoring Guide](MONITORING_GUIDE.md).

Quick tips:
- Follow logs in real-time: `journalctl -u deus-enhanced.service -f`
- View detailed logs: `tail -f /home/DeusExMachina/var/logs/deus.log`
- Check service status: `systemctl status deus-enhanced.service`
- Monitor different consciousness states (DORMANT, DROWSY, AWARE, ALERT, FULLY_AWAKE)
- Track AI provider usage and system health assessments

For deployment instructions, see [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

## Weekly Email Reports

The enhanced system can send weekly email reports summarizing system health, incidents, and recommendations. To set up email reporting:

1. Edit `/home/DeusExMachina/config/report_config.json` with your email settings:
   ```json
   {
     "email_provider": "smtp",  // Options: smtp, sendgrid, mailgun
     "report_email": "your-email@example.com",
     "email_config": {
       "smtp_server": "smtp.example.com",
       "smtp_port": 587,
       "smtp_username": "username",
       "smtp_password": "password"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Add the provided crontab entry to your system:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   # Add the line from /home/DeusExMachina/config/crontab_addition.txt
   ```

3. Generate a sample report to preview the format:
   ```bash
   python3 /home/DeusExMachina/enhanced/generate_sample_report.py
   ```

The report includes current system metrics, service health, state transitions, and recommendations for optimizing your server.

## Layers of Awareness

### 1. Heartbeat (every 30s to 2 min)
- Liveness checks: CPU, RAM, disk usage, essential process health
- Port scans, interface status, system load average
- Deltas stored locally and optionally reported externally

### 2. Breath (every 10â€“30 min)
- Hashes of config files and binaries
- File size/permissions in key paths (e.g., /etc, /usr/bin, /home)
- Systemd status, cron jobs, new services
- Resource trend analysis

### 3. Vigilance (event-triggered or hourly)
- Deep file diffing via Merkle tree
- Anomaly detection in auth logs and system events
- Suspicious network traffic, unexpected listeners
- Optional AI summarization and response planning

## State Machine

| State        | Description                                  | Action Scope           |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Normal       | All systems operating within tolerance       | Heartbeat only        |
| Suspicious   | Minor anomalies detected                     | Heartbeat + Breath     |
| Alert        | Clear deviation or risk                      | Trigger Vigilance      |
| Critical     | Confirmed compromise or failure              | Vigilance + AI Wake-Up |

Each state has a TTL and decays or escalates as conditions persist.

---

## AI Integration: Awakened Awareness

The AI (Gemini) is dormant by default.
When the Vigilance module detects critical conditions:
- Gemini is invoked via `ai_brain.py`
- It analyzes recent log anomalies
- It leaves a structured reflection in `ai_assessment.json`
- Designed to eventually support deeper investigation or mitigation


---

### ðŸ§  Neuro-Inspired Architecture

Deus Ex Machina is more than a monitoring scriptâ€”it's a sentient control loop inspired by the architecture of the human nervous system.

Just like the body, the system operates in **layers of awareness**, only escalating in complexity and cognition when necessary:

| System Layer | Analogy                        | Function                                                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Heartbeat**| Medulla / Pulse                | Continuous, low-effort liveness check                       |
| **Breath**   | Visceral awareness             | Periodic config, process, and integrity scans               |
| **Vigilance**| Neocortex / Higher cognition   | Deep anomaly inspection; AI wakes up to interpret the world |

This design allows the AI to stay dormant during stable periodsâ€”burning zero compute. But when thresholds are crossed, the system awakens. The cortex lights up. The machine "notices," begins to **think**, and then **leaves itself a structured reflection** via Gemini.

In this model, token usage is sacred. The AI becomes a background overseerâ€”a latent guardian that activates only when silence breaks. Its role is not constant control, but rare, high-value cognition.

---

## How It Runs

- `heartbeat.sh` runs every 1 minute via systemd service
- `state_engine.py` evaluates current metrics (every 2 minutes)
- `state_trigger.py` determines if breath or vigilance should run
- `breath.sh` performs integrity and config checks
- `vigilance.sh` performs deep analysis and calls `ai_brain.py`
- `ai_brain.py` is invoked *only by* `vigilance.sh` when alert conditions exist

---

## Installation

The simplest way to install Deus Ex Machina is using the provided installation script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/novalis78/deus-ex-machina.git
cd deus-ex-machina

# Set the API key (never commit this!)
echo 'GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-google-api-key-here"' > config/gemini_config.py

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
chmod +x core/**/*.sh

# Run the installer as root
sudo ./scripts/install.sh
```

Alternatively, you can set up the system manually as described below.

---

## Cronjob Setup and Timing

Here's how to schedule everything if you're using `cron`. Use `crontab -e` to edit root/system cron:

```cron
# Run state engine every 2 minutes
*/2 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /opt/deus-ex-machina/core/state_engine/state_engine.py >> /var/log/deus-ex-machina/state_engine.log 2>&1

# Run trigger (launches breath/vigilance based on state)
*/2 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /opt/deus-ex-machina/core/state_engine/state_trigger.py >> /var/log/deus-ex-machina/state_trigger.log 2>&1
```

`heartbeat.sh` is designed to run as a persistent **systemd service**, like so:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/deus-heartbeat.service
[Unit]
Description=Deus Ex Machina Heartbeat Monitor
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/deus-ex-machina/core/heartbeat/heartbeat.sh
Restart=always
User=root
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable with:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now deus-heartbeat
```

## Configuration 

### Environment Variables
The system now supports configuration through environment variables:

- `DEUS_INSTALL_DIR`: Installation directory (default: `/opt/deus-ex-machina`)
- `DEUS_LOG_DIR`: Log directory (default: `/var/log/deus-ex-machina`)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google Gemini API key for AI analysis

### Configuration Files
The main configuration files are:

1. `config/config.py`: Central Python configuration
2. `config/gemini_config.py`: API key for Gemini (fallback if not in environment)
3. `scripts/bash_config.sh`: Shared configuration for bash scripts

At minimum, you must provide a Gemini API key in either:
- The environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`, or
- The `config/gemini_config.py` file

Remember to ensure `gemini_config.py` is **not committed** by adding it to your `.gitignore`.

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the API key in environment or `gemini_config.py`
3. Run the installation script or set up manually:
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/install.sh
   ```
4. The system will begin monitoring with heartbeat active
5. Logs and insights will accumulate in `/var/log/deus-ex-machina/`

### Testing the AI Awakening

To test if the AI can properly awaken and analyze alerts, use the included test script:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/test_ai_wake.sh
```

This script:
1. Generates simulated alert conditions
2. Sets the system state to "alert"
3. Triggers the vigilance module and AI brain
4. Verifies if the AI produced an assessment

After running, you can examine the AI's thoughts in `/var/log/deus-ex-machina/ai_assessment.json`.

---

## Listening to the AI's Experience

Deus Ex Machina allows you to "listen in" on what the AI is experiencing and thinking during its periods of awareness:

1. **Monitoring Core Logs**:
   - `/var/log/deus-ex-machina/heartbeat.log`: Basic system metrics
   - `/var/log/deus-ex-machina/breath.log`: Configuration and integrity checks
   - `/var/log/deus-ex-machina/vigilance.log`: Deep analysis and anomaly detection

2. **Following State Transitions**:
   - `/var/log/deus-ex-machina/state_engine.log`: Shows when and why state changes occur
   - `/var/log/deus-ex-machina/state.json`: Current system state

3. **AI Awakened Consciousness**:
   - `/var/log/deus-ex-machina/vigilance_alerts.log`: Events that triggered AI awareness
   - `/var/log/deus-ex-machina/ai_assessment.json`: The AI's structured reflections and analysis
   - `/var/log/deus-ex-machina/ai_brain.log`: Log of the AI's activity and decision process

The `ai_assessment.json` file is particularly interesting as it contains the AI's structured thoughts about anomalies it detects - including severity assessments, analysis of patterns, and recommendations. This file is only updated when the system reaches alert state and the AI "awakens" to analyze the situation.
