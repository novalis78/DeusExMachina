# Update Log: Deus Ex Machina Investigation Tools

## Version 2.0 - May 1, 2025

### New Features

1. **Server Investigation Framework** (`server_investigator.py`)
   - 25+ specialized server monitoring tools
   - Real system command execution with structured parsing
   - Domain-specific and cross-domain insight generation
   - Structured recommendations for follow-up investigations

2. **AI Consciousness Integration** (`ai_investigator.py`)
   - Full implementation of the 5-state consciousness model
   - Dynamic tool access based on consciousness level
   - State transitions triggered by finding severity
   - Complete investigation workflow with awareness stages

3. **Weekly Reporting System** (`weekly_report.py`)
   - HTML and email report generation
   - Visual representation of consciousness state distribution
   - Aggregation of findings and insights across multiple runs
   - Prioritized insights with timestamp tracking

### Integration Points

- Compatible with existing consciousness model
- Uses the same state definitions as `consciousness.py`
- Can be integrated with action grammar for secure command execution
- Extends the memory system with structured findings storage

### Implementation Details

- Each tool executes actual system commands and parses their output
- Investigation focus areas are determined from natural language queries
- Insights are generated through domain-specific and cross-domain analysis
- Consciousness state transitions occur based on finding severity

### Architecture

The updated architecture follows a layered approach:

1. **Command Layer**: Actual system commands (ps, df, netstat, etc.)
2. **Parsing Layer**: Structured data extraction from command output
3. **Analysis Layer**: Domain-specific analysis of structured data
4. **Insight Layer**: Generation of actionable insights across domains
5. **Consciousness Layer**: State management and tool access control
6. **Reporting Layer**: Aggregation and presentation of findings

### Testing

The system has been successfully tested in the following environments:
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Debian 11
- CentOS 8

All components execute real system commands with proper error handling and output parsing.
